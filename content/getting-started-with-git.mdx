# Getting Started with Git: A Beginner's Guide

If you're learning programming, you've probably heard of **Git**.\
At first, it can seem confusing --- but it's actually very simple once
you understand the basics.

## What is Git?

Git is a **version control system**.

That means it helps you:

-   Track changes in your code\
-   Go back to older versions if something breaks\
-   Work with other developers without overwriting each other's work

Think of Git like a "save history" system for your projects.

## Why Should You Use Git?

Without Git:

-   You might create files like
    `project-final-v2-final-really-final.js`\
-   You can accidentally lose important code\
-   Team collaboration becomes messy

With Git:

-   Every change is recorded\
-   You can undo mistakes\
-   Teams can work smoothly together

## Basic Git Commands

Here are a few essential commands to get started:

### 1. Initialize Git in a Project

``` bash
git init
```

This creates a new Git repository in your folder.

### 2. Check Status

``` bash
git status
```

Shows what files have changed.

### 3. Add Files

``` bash
git add .
```

Stages your changes.

### 4. Commit Changes

``` bash
git commit -m "add homepage layout"
```

Saves your changes with a message.

### 5. Push to GitHub

``` bash
git push
```

Uploads your code to a remote repository.

## Final Thoughts

Git may feel overwhelming at first, but you only need a few commands to
get started.

Start small.\
Practice daily.\
And soon, Git will feel natural.

Happy coding!
